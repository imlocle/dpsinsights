12/13/2016,0.29302721088435374,Positive,"Best..haircut..ever! It's wild how noticeably better of a haircut I received from Mike at Main Street than I've been receiving from my regular barber, and I thought my regular barber always did a great job. Excellent fade work right into my beard, and the hard point is spot on. I had just trimmed my beard this morning, and thought I did a decent job of it :/ Mike finished what I started and it made a world of a difference. Guess I should leave it to the pros. Excellent work guys I'll be back for sure!",0
11/14/2016,0.08327335858585859,Positive,"Are you looking for a drunk to cut you hair really really fast while not paying attention? Are you looking for a place to pay extra for a beard trim and for them to completely mess up your facial hair? Or how about being talked down to and being told to shut up or he'll shave you mustache off? Or maybe you're interested in hearing how high this guy was last night and how he thinks he might STILL be high? Well if you are looking for all that and more, this is the place for you! There's a reason this place never has a wait! Do yourself a favor and drive to Sunset Beach and go to Harbor Barber!",0
7/29/2015,-0.04318181818181818,Negative,"Terrible Experience! I came here because my barber, Luis, who works at another shop now, couldn't see me but I needed a cut fast for an event.  When I came back I told Mike that Luis couldn't see me and when I asked if he could fit me in he goes off on me for coming to him because I couldn't see Luis. I then left and said I can go somewhere else. To this, Mike replied ""I don't give a f**k"" and I said as I left ""goodbye"". Mike then storms out of the store and berated me saying ""What did you say? What did you say?"" as I was leaving.  I remembered why I was so excited to see Luis at his new shop because Mike makes clients uncomfortable. EDIT: after the harassment I recieved online from Mike I'm downgrading my review to one star.",1
9/15/2017,0.4333333333333333,Positive,"Best hair cut! $20 for a regular men's cut. Mike is fantastic. A talented barber, businessman and entertaining guy. I'm now a regular. He offered me lunch. I just eat so I passed.",0
10/21/2016,0.3647727272727273,Positive,"I've been coming here for 5 years. Mike is friends with anyone that sits in his chair. This is what separates a barbershop from anything else. Add to the friendly service, great attitude of Mike and the cool memorabilia adorning the walls, the most important thing here is that Mike has the gift! Best fade you'll ever find and absolute precision on the cut. I can't even believe it took me this long to review this place! Today my 2 year old son got his first haircut in the same chair I've been coming to since before he was born. Mike is the man!",0
9/29/2016,0.7464285714285714,Positive,Mike and his shop are the best in SoCal. In a word - awesome. I moved an hour away about a year ago and still drive to Seal Beach to get my hair cut. LA traffic? For a haircut? That's right. Boom. Mic dropped. It's that good.,0
4/16/2016,0.31666666666666665,Positive,I've come to this barbershop on and off for a couple of years.  I had a barber I really clicked with that moved away a couple years ago.  He was great.  Meticulous and really paid attn to detail without a heavy hand.  Today was Max's first day at the barbershop.  I this cut and shave are exactly what I was looking for and Max has great technique!  I haven't been so happy with the results in months and I really enjoyed meeting him.Max definitely goes the extra step!  I'd recommend him and I will definitely go back to him!,0
1/20/2016,0.06197916666666667,Positive,Strolled in a little over a year ago for a clean up and 2 things keep me coming back:The environment. It's a classic barber shop where everyone is at home sitting back with a cold beverage while shooting the breeze.Attention to detail. Mike and his barbers provide an impeccable grooming experience because their knowledge and recommendations are tailored to each individual customer. Unlike big chain haircutting businesses where you are just another transaction.,0
8/10/2016,0.20378787878787882,Positive,"I've only been there a couple of times, but so far so good.  They really do a good job.  I'm very picky about cutting my hair and have been through numerous barbers looking for a good barber.  They are clean and friendly.  Parking sucks though...",0
8/31/2015,0.1789231601731602,Positive,"Writing this for my husband:""Hadn't found a good barber since living in Oakland but, walked into this place and the owner cut my hair, right away I knew I had found my new barber. It is small but, decor is awesome, and you are offered beer, which really gives you the feel of an old school barber shop.Every time I've been there, both, employees and customers are engaged in barber-shop-conversation which to me, is kind of important as I find it awfully awkward just sitting in a chair staring at yourself with no kind of rapport between oneself and the other person. Also, military-friendly""",0
6/3/2015,0.27878787878787875,Positive,"You get what you pay for, $20.00 and a quality cut by good people. I found my new local place for haircuts.",0
1/17/2015,0.2995920745920746,Positive,"Came here with my girlfriend today, didn't really know what to expect but from the look of the people coming out of the shop you could tell they knew what they were doing. Mike cut my hair and he's been a barber for many years so his technique really shows, my girlfriend said I looked like a new man and I had to agree the hair cut was super fresh. Picked up some pomade and grooming spray for reshaping because my hair grows REALLY fast.    If you're looking for a great haircut in the Seal Beach area this place is practically a must for you. Affordable prices, accepts walk-ins, not a long wait time and a legit haircut puts this place at 5 out of 5 stars.   On a side note this place has quite a bit of history and heritage and inside and out you can really tell that it's an authentic old school barbershop with genuine style and decor.",0
4/20/2016,0.05380952380952384,Positive,"I have the craziest thick set of hair i havnt had much luck with barbers till now , Mike nails it every time. I've been going to Mike now for a couple years. His shop is bad ass and very clean with a cool vibe, not to mention the sweet big screen tv u get to watch while mike goes to town on your hair ! Def 5 stars",0
2/29/2016,0.23285714285714287,Positive,Average very over priced.  The place has a very trendy trying to be a hipster vibe. So many better local options don't waste your time or money.,0

5/15/2014,0.52,Positive,I went there a couple days ago and it was my second time at this great barber shop.  Luis is a great guy and he will make you look awesome! I will definitely keep coming to this place to get my haircuts!!,0
1/9/2016,0.4275,Positive,Just found this place through great yelp reviews. High quality hair cuts and amazing straight razor shaves.

4/2/2014,0.5,Positive,"Great service, great haircut!I went in not knowing what to expect (I did ready the yelp reviews, but still was unsure).  Louis was fantastic!  He gave me such a goo cut that I brought my two boys in straight away.He was especially good with the boys and I would recommend him to all men out there!",0
12/5/2013,0.1761904761904762,Positive,"I've never had a real shave before, so I went in tentatively. However, Luis made me feel comfortable. He took his time, kept the shop open late, and finished with professionalism. If I ever go back to make my face as smooth as it did when I was 15, I'll be asking for him. As for the shop, it was clean and definitely a man cave. The college football games were on, and the ambiance definitely made masculinity feel at home. The price was more than reasonable for the time spent. Almost an hour in the chair with a shave and cut for 45$ plus tip is more than worth it.",0
11/26/2014,0.4166666666666667,Positive,Always 5 stars here.  Mike does a fantastic job and he knows my hair better than I do.  The best part is that you never need an appointment.  They always make you feel welcome!  What guy wants to make an appointment.  You can get the hipster haircut here without the degenerate hipster cutting your hair.,0
12/6/2014,0.5194444444444445,Positive,"I can get a good shave and haircut most places, However, I go to the Main Street Barber Shop because I can Walk here from home, the shave and haircut are the BEST, and I can really relax while I'm here!

12/31/2013,0.24444444444444444,Positive,"I'm pretty particular when it comes to my hair and I've been to plenty of barbers, salons, stupercuts, etc...and this place is by far the best spot. The owner mike is passionate about his craft, and treats his customers with the care and respect that one should expect. I'll be going back there to get cleaned up for years to come.",0
4/25/2015,0.19526515151515147,Positive,"Amanda is kind and hospitable. She said she is relatively new to this shop but not new to cutting hair cause she gave me a great cut even though I was admittedly pretty vague about what I wanted. She also hooked it up with a redbull cause it was like 9am and I wasn't feeling a beer just yet. Are free drinks the norm at barber shops? I don't think so but from reading other reviews it may be the norm here. Nothing but good things to say about this place for my first experience. Love the ambiance, service and attention to detail.",0
3/2/2015,0.38277777777777783,Positive,"Great haircut! A lady did mine--her name is currently slipping my mind. It was her first day when I got my cut. She did a very nice, clean cut. My cut was $20--worth every penny. I would go back here.",0
4/18/2015,0.28809523809523807,Positive,Stopped by for a quick cut and couldn't have asked for anything better. Mike was super nice and cut my hair exactly how I wanted it. They have beer on tap and I'm definitely gonna have one next time I come in!,0
2/28/2015,0.3804166666666667,Positive,"Awesome little shop with old school charm and great service. My boyfriend had his second haircut with Mike today and is looking quite studly. Both cuts were walk-ins and he was taken immediately. Mike was super friendly/accommodating both times and dealt with the dreaded girlfriend-bringing-a-picture-to-replicate situation with a smile. My bf is very happy with his ""gentleman's cut"" and left the shop with product knowledge for maintaining the style.Thanks for keeping my man clean, Mike!",0
10/6/2013,0.55,Positive,Mike is the best! I drive all the way from La Habra because my six year old son loves to visit his buddy.,0
2/27/2015,0.41904761904761906,Positive,"Mike (the owner) has been cutting my hair once a month for about a year. The haircut is perfect every time! I love the barber shop feel to the place , and everyone is nice and treats you with respect. It gets busy on the weekends because it's a well known place, but the line goes quick, and there is always a tv show or movie to watch. You can't beat the price either.  I'll never get my hair cut anywhere else. They also sell excellent products there.",0
12/21/2014,0.43797348484848486,Positive,"Walked in to this shop on a random Saturday and found my new barber! Mike is awesome. Easy to talk to and cuts great hair. Appointments can be made by txt or just walk in and get in line. Always a fun, enjoyable experience and his prices are great.",0
10/24/2014,0.4037619047619048,Positive,"This place is AWESOME! Luis did a fantastic job! He hooked me up with a tight, gentleman's cut with my permission to cut it however he wanted...and I couldn't have asked for a better cut! And not only was the haircut great BUT Luis and Mike were so cool, welcoming and easy to talk to. Great guys! And if you like classic cars Mike will talk your ear off (in a good way); ask about his Impalas.  :-) I highly recommend this place and will DEFINITELY be coming back.",0
9/8/2014,0.4,Positive,"I've been going there for about six months now...Luis is great. Not only do I dig the haircut, so does my wife!  Now my two boys go too.  If you have time, get a shave too!",0

10/1/2014,0.6375,Positive,"One of, if not the best barbershops in the country. Great talent! You'll feel great coming out. They're even great with young boys. I've been taking my son since he was two years old now my son is three. Make an appointment though!",0
7/11/2014,0.6,Positive,"I am not the kind of guy that goes to just one barber shop or has a ""guy"" that takes care of my cut.  Going here makes me want to be that guy.  Mike was my barber and he did a great job.  Got compliments on the cut from my wife, co workers and friends.  You can tell he pays attention to the details, and the vibe of the shop is awesome.  I will definitely be back.",0
9/25/2015,0.18333333333333335,Positive,This place is small and quaint.  I was offered a drink while I waited.  Mike gave me a great haircut.  I'll be back!,0
9/25/2015,0.15238095238095237,Positive,Mike and his crew do it right!  Old school hospitality and solid cuts. I make the drive from L.A. for this place.,0
10/8/2015,0.3194196428571429,Positive,"The best barber shop around! Always consistent with service and hospitality. Mike manages to keep the classic style of a barber shop with its look and atmosphere. Never have I found a shop quite as unique as this one. I've been a customer for about 4 years now and have always received a perfect cut, mostly because Mike and his assistant are very personable in that they know and remember exactly how I like my hair. I've always had a phobia of receiving a hair cut prior to Main St. Barber because no one could ever get it right. Thanks to Mike and Main St. Barber, that phobia is in the past. Thank you Mike for all your great cuts and I can't wait to come back!",0
10/14/2015,0.15,Positive,Nice cozy barber shop - sports on TV - offer you a cold beer when you arrive - $20 haircut - old fashioned shop with top-notch service. Offers straight razor shaves. I'll definitely be back.,0
12/27/2013,0.12715608465608466,Positive,"i like the fact that this place opens at 9am.i work thursday nights and after my shift i usually go to the gym and by the time i'm done it's almost 9am.so i really like it's convenient business hours and thefact that it's down the street from my gym.i went here for the first time a few months ago and got a hair cut from guy whose name i believe is luis.he gave me a nice high and tight style comb over that i requested.the second time i went here was about a month ago but received my cut from an elderly gentleman.he seemed to be knowledgeable and the way he cut my hair was precision like in movement; a tell tale sign of a seasoned barber.however, it wasn't the cut i had asked for and upon returning home, it was evident that the blend on the sides was, to put it nicely, unfavorable.my advice? i'd stick with luis.",0
3/5/2012,0.20606060606060608,Positive,"Mike the owner/barber is the best. He's been my husband's go-to-barber for years. He's recently purchased and remodeled this shop on Main Street and it's totally spiffy.  He's hilarious as always and the cold beer or coke or whatever doesn't hurt the social vibe... hahaha  Go check out the new wall painting he's got, it's 3-D, and it's his favorite red Shelby!  Ah and there are plenty places around the Barber Shop if you want to grab a bite or the girl prefers to take a stroll while the guy's at it.  I usually choose to stay and hear what Mike has to say.  It's the main street barber shop where you get all the scoop and then leave feelin' good about pretty much everything... :)",0
9/17/2015,0.05328282828282827,Positive,"I've been a customer for over 3 years now and was very happy until my last cut.  Mike has been my ""Go too"" guy when I need my cut.  I asked for my usual ""clean up the sides and take the bulk out of the top"". I'm not sure what happened, he said he didn't remember how he did it in the past.  He asked what shear length we used and I did not remember (why would I).  Since I could not remember the details of the shear lengths, I ended up with a ¼"" buzz cut.  I was very disappointed and felt that Mike had let me down.  He was aware of my concerns and dissatisfaction but he still charged me full price for a two minute haircut.  I will not return.",0
4/28/2014,0.4597537878787879,Positive,Totally recommend this place!! I just moved here so I was super nervous about having someone new cut my hair.  Mike did an awesome job and his pricing is great.  And does a better job than those $45 salons. If you want a good cut. Go to Main Street barber!,0
8/16/2013,0.12063492063492065,Positive,"I was really in need of a cut before I left for Vegas, showed up right after they closed the doors for the night. Knocked on the door and he still let me, totally understood my situation. Said there was a time were he was in the same spot and the barber closed up anyway and he never forgot it. Great cut too. Definitely recommend this place.",0
10/2/2013,0.3958333333333333,Positive,"No complaints about this place. It has a old style barbershop feel. The employees here are very friendly and trusting.

8/28/2013,0.3462121212121212,Positive,This barbershop is awesome!  It has a genuine feeling to it as a real barbershop should.  It's kept clean and has some nice flat screen tv's.  Mike the barber is the man along with Ernie and the rest of the crew.  You can't  go wrong hanging out here and maybe even get a haircut if you need.  I feel the best thing at the Main Street barbershop Is that the straight razor shave is always available.,0
2/27/2015,0.2899509803921569,Positive,"Main Street Barber Shop is a cool little spot that you can duck into, get a good looking cut, and be out in no time.  Having been in my fair share of salon's or hair boutiques based off of others recommendations over the years, this is wildly different.  It is all based off of a first come first serve basis, unless you are held up by the rare appointment that one of the barbers is holding a chair for.  There is no fake banter or placating words of wisdom.  This is a dudes shop.  You can talk about whatever you want to talk about, as if you're just hanging out with your buddies, and that makes the environment all that much better.  On top of the excellent atmosphere, the haircuts are on point.  They ask you what you want, you can stop them mid cut and ask to tweak things here or there, and they really pay attention to their craft.  They also recommend and support good products that have improved the way I style my hair.  I come in here every one to two months, and I never leave disappointed with the end results.",0
2/28/2015,0.2763299200799201,Positive,"I moved to seal beach over a month ago and have been looking for a great barber since. I'm from the east coast and as soon as I said that mike (the owner) told willy (guy cutting me) these guys love low fades, straight lines and perfection. Just like that mike knew what I wanted and willy made it happen. Usually I'm very hesitant to step into a new barbershop because they can never get what I wanted right. At this barber shop they did this and more. As I was sitting in the barber shop I was reading all the one stars and was thinking to myself really one stars? The guy that mike was cutting left with a great cut. Mike even cut my brothers hair and he's also picky with his haircuts and was more than happy with his haircut. Mike was never rude. This was my first time in the shop and not my last. Found my barber out here in southern cali! Willy is a great barber pulled out all the tricks for me. Kind of reminded me of manny paquio only a hair cutter. Haha supper cool guy and great with the trimmer. Thanks again guys!!",0

3/16/2010,0.35540674603174605,Positive,"I went here today during my lunch break on my quest to find that perfect 'main street' barber shop. All I can say is my search is over. Ernie did a GREAT job, making sure I received the best quality haircut and beard trim. He cleaned me up nice too; straight razor to the neck line and beard line, a little aftershave and hair tonic on the head).I walked in and felt right at home, while I read a magazine and waited for a chair to open. All in all by the time I walked in and out was 20 min.I will DEFINITELY be adding coming here to my weekly routine.   NOTE: They are closed from noon-1PM for lunch.",0
9/3/2014,0.13201754385964912,Positive,"The first time I went to the shop I got great service and was impressed with the work.  The second time, I took my 11 year-old son with the intent that we would both get our hair cut.  The man who cut my hair the first time wasn't there this time.  My son went first as only one chair was empty.  The other chair was soon empty and instead of being greeted by the barber that was just freed up, he proceed to lay back on the barber chair and immerse himself in his phone, as if I wasn't there.  Then I noticed there was a wall of Playboy magazines, which is completely inappropriate.  Finally, the women working on my son's hair, which only took 5 minutes, charged me a full $20.  If they had any chance of getting my business again, they might have considered giving me a break for such a quick job.  That is the last $20 they will receive from me.  Needless to say, no tip was forthcoming.",0
1/11/2012,0.16361111111111112,Positive,"My boyfriend and I just moved to California from Boston (he's from France) so when he needed a haircut I searched Yelp for reviews. Main Street Barber came up and since it was really close, we decided to give it a try. This was my boyfriend's first time at a barber shop since they don't have them in France so he was a little skeptical. However, Mike the Barber was amazing! He was very personable and friendly and even offered us free drinks. I LOVE my boyfriend's haircut. It's a much cleaner and styled cut than he usually gets from salons. We don't need to look any further for a barber, we will definitely be frequent customers. Thanks Mike!",0
5/13/2012,0.2484307359307359,Positive,"After trying 3 other barbers, I found Mike at his old 2nd St shop. His new shop is awesome. If there's a bit of a wait, you don't care. It's that kind of place. Cold beer, sports on the TV, this is a man's barber shop and the conversation is good. No matter what kind of day you're having you leave feeling better about things.I've recently relocated to North Carolina, tried a couple shops over there, it didn't go so well. Fortunately I travel back to LA/OC for work and when I do I make time to go to the Main Street Barber Shop.",0
